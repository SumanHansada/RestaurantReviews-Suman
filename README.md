# Restaurant Reviews: Stage 1

This is a Project for Udacity Front-End Web Developer NanoDegree

## Overview
This is the final project of Udacity Front-End Web Developer NanoDegree. In this project I converted a static web page to a mobile-ready web application. I made this application responsive to make it work on all screen sizes. It is also accessible for screen readers. I have also implemented a service worker for making the application offline-first.
